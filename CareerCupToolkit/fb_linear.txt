Question 1-20: https://careercup.com/question?id=5080100049518592
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are given a set of points on x axis (consumers)
Also you are given a set of points on a plane (producer)

For every consumer print the nearest producer.
Wanted something better than O(n^2) time.

Example:
consumers: 1 5 7
producers: (0, 3), (1,1), (3, 2), (8, 10), (9, 100)

Answer:
for 1 nearest producer is (1, 1), for 5 nearest is (3, 2), for 7 nearest is (3, 2)

Follow-up question: now both sets are sorted by x coordinate. Could you come up with a linear algorithm?
